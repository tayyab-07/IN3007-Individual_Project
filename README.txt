IN3007 Individual Project


My Individual Project is "Game Design Principles".
The premise of the project is to create a game using the Unity engine that will incorporate good game design philosophies.
I will research and make a handbook for utilising these design principles in other games.
I will also be making my own complete game in Unity using these very same principles.
